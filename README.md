# Frontend base story point estimation

A small project for estimation of base story point for one frontend developer with React and its unit tests could be a simple e-commerce website that allows users to browse and purchase products. The project could include the following features:

- Product Catalog: Users can view a list of products, including the product name, image, description, and price.

- Product Detail View: Users can view the details of a specific product, including the product name, image, description, and price.

- Shopping Cart: Users can add products to a shopping cart, view the contents of their cart, and update the quantity of items in their cart.

- Checkout: Users can enter their shipping and payment information and complete the purchase of their items.

- User Authentication: Users can create an account, log in, and log out of the system.

- Unit Tests: The project could include unit tests for the frontend code, including tests for the React components and Redux store.

The project could be developed using React for the frontend and Redux for state management. To estimate the base story points for this project, the frontend developer could break down each feature into smaller tasks, estimate the effort required for each task in story points, and then use the total story points to estimate the overall effort required for the project. The estimated story points could be used to create a backlog of tasks for the project, and the developer could use the backlog to plan their work.

The unit tests for the project could be developed using a testing framework such as Jest and could include tests for each React component and Redux action. The unit tests could help the developer to ensure that the frontend code is functioning correctly and help to prevent bugs and regressions. The time required to write and run the unit tests could also be factored into the overall story point estimation for the project.
